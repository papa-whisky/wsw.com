          <p>
            Ceremony and reception at The Burrow in Denver, on Saturday 11th
            December, 2021 at 4pm (please arrive at 3:30pm).
          </p>
          <h4>Where the heck is Denver?</h4>
          <p>
            Great question. Denver is a locality between Daylesford and Kyneton,
            about 100kms Northwest of Melbourne.<br />
            Clare grew up in Denver, and her parents lived there from 1986 until
            2015. There are no shops, pubs or public transport. However, there
            are thousands of kangaroos, stunning bushland and, since 2017, a
            wedding venue,

          </p>
          <h4>Transportation</h4>
          <p>
            A complimentary bus will take guests between Daylesford and The
            Burrow. The bus will depart from the Daylesford Post Office at
            <b>3.00pm</b>. The bus will leave The Burrow at 11pm and return
            guests to the Daylesford Post Office.<br />
            If you are staying at Jubilee Lake Holiday Park, please let us know,
            so we can arrange for the bus to drop you off.
          </p>
          <h4>Accommodation</h4>
          <p>
            Daylesford being Daylesford, there are many accommodation options. A
            few helpful links and suggestions are below.<br />
            Hot tip: check the location is close to the Post Office if you are

          <p>Cocktail.</p>
          <h4>Gifts</h4>
          <p>Your attendance is more than we could hope for. Honestly.</p>
          <h4>If you absolutely must but are unsure what to get</h4>
          <p>
            We would like to start an art collection. Any financial assistance
            from our friends and family to help us acquire an original artwork
            (or two!) would be fantastic. We think this would be a long-lasting
            and unique way to remember the beginning of our marriage.
          </p>
          <h4>RSVP</h4>
          <p>

          <h4>Thank you</h4>
          <p>
            Obviously we will go into far more depth on this topic on the day,

            excited) about sharing this special day with you in Denver.
